Dashoboard Design

When designing data visualizations, it's important to focus on clarity and simplicity. Your visual should tell a story, where the viewer immediately understands the most important insights.
Each chart has its strengths. For instance, bar charts are great for comparing categories, while line charts show trends over time.
Interactive dashboards allow users to dive deeper into the data. I've added filters so users can select different time periods or categories and see the data update dynamically.
